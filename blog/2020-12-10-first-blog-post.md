Hi, I’m Matías Iglesias—a data scientist and economist who’s passionate about understanding how the small effects of individual firms are accounted in the big picture of our economy. As a researcher in Economics, I’ve poured my energy into researching the aggregation of firm-level fluctuations into national economic trends. 

But I realized something: even the most insightful research can remain hidden if it’s buried in a dense long document. That’s why I built this site—a place where my thesis comes to life as an interactive, readable, and accessible resource.

## Why I Created This Site

When I finished my thesis, I felt both proud and frustrated. I had answers to questions like: 
- Why does aggregate volatility sometimes remain high despite a large number of firms?
- How do firm size distributions shape the national economy’s shocks?
- What role do non-linearities and micro shocks play in shaping aggregate trends?

Yet these answers were trapped in a static PDF—hard to navigate, hard to share, and hard to update.

So I built this site as a **dynamic companion** to my thesis—a place where each chapter is a web page, and each insight can be linked, browsed, and even updated as new research emerges.

## What You’ll Find Here

This is a **structured journey** through the core themes that drive my research:

- **Aggregate Volatility**: How individual firm fluctuations aggregate into national patterns—and why it matters.
- **Firm Size Distributions**: How a few large firms can dominate economic dynamics.
- **Quantile Analysis**: A fresh perspective on analyzing groups of firms and their contributions to aggregate variance.
- **Technical Frameworks**: Rigorous, math-backed derivations for the curious and the technical-minded.
- **Data Insights**: Grounded in French customs trade data, showing how theory meets the real world.

Each section is designed to be **approachable yet rigorous**—so that whether you’re an economist, a data scientist, or simply curious, you can dive in at your own pace.

## Why It Matters

Economic fluctuations affect us all—from policymakers designing regulations to investors assessing risks. By making this knowledge accessible, I hope to spark **better conversations**, **smarter decisions**, and **more resilient economies**.

For example: understanding that idiosyncratic variance doesn’t always vanish at scale helps explain why crises can emerge even in seemingly diversified systems. Insights like these can shape policies that account for real-world complexities rather than relying on oversimplified models.
