As a researcher in Economics, I\u2019ve poured my energy into researching the aggregation of firm-level fluctuations into national economic trends. \\n\\nBut I realized something: even the most insightful research can remain hidden if it\u2019s buried in a dense long document. That\u2019s why I built this site\u2014a place where my thesis comes to life as an interactive, readable, and accessible resource.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why I Created This Site\\n\\nWhen I finished my thesis, I felt both proud and frustrated. I had answers to questions like: \\n- Why does aggregate volatility sometimes remain high despite a large number of firms?\\n- How do firm size distributions shape the national economy\u2019s shocks?\\n- What role do non-linearities and micro shocks play in shaping aggregate trends?\\n\\nYet these answers were trapped in a static PDF\u2014hard to navigate, hard to share, and hard to update.\\n\\nSo I built this site as a **dynamic companion** to my thesis\u2014a place where each chapter is a web page, and each insight can be linked, browsed, and even updated as new research emerges.\\n\\n## What You\u2019ll Find Here\\n\\nThis is a **structured journey** through the core themes that drive my research:\\n\\n- **Aggregate Volatility**: How individual firm fluctuations aggregate into national patterns\u2014and why it matters.\\n- **Firm Size Distributions**: How a few large firms can dominate economic dynamics.\\n- **Quantile Analysis**: A fresh perspective on analyzing groups of firms and their contributions to aggregate variance.\\n- **Technical Frameworks**: Rigorous, math-backed derivations for the curious and the technical-minded.\\n- **Data Insights**: Grounded in French customs trade data, showing how theory meets the real world.\\n\\nEach section is designed to be **approachable yet rigorous**\u2014so that whether you\u2019re an economist, a data scientist, or simply curious, you can dive in at your own pace.\\n\\n## Why It Matters\\n\\nEconomic fluctuations affect us all\u2014from policymakers designing regulations to investors assessing risks. By making this knowledge accessible, I hope to spark **better conversations**, **smarter decisions**, and **more resilient economies**.\\n\\nFor example: understanding that idiosyncratic variance doesn\u2019t always vanish at scale helps explain why crises can emerge even in seemingly diversified systems. Insights like these can shape policies that account for real-world complexities rather than relying on oversimplified models.\\n\\n## Let\u2019s Connect\\n\\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or even collaborate on related projects.
