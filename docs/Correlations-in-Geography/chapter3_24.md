## Results: Geographical Patterns

In this section, we delve into the **geographical patterns** emerging from our analysis of industry networks. These patterns reveal how industries are distributed across different regions, highlighting significant locational correlations.

### Themes of Spatial Distribution

The components identified are grouped into four **themes** of spatial distribution:

- **Population**: Driven by consumer demand, this theme includes non-tradables like stores and personal services.
- **Cities**: Influenced by urban agglomeration externalities, this theme encompasses large city economies and other high-wage activities.
- **Land Uses**: Determined by the availability of natural resources, this theme covers agriculture, food production, water economy, fuels, mining, forests, and timber.
- **Manufacturing**: Dominated by manufacturing externalities, this theme includes the Steel Belt and other manufacturing activities.

Below is a summary table of the detected themes and their components:

| **Theme**       | **Component**                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Population      | Non-tradables: stores and personal services     |
| Cities          | Large city economies I                          |
|                 | Large city economies II                         |
|                 | Other high wage activities                      |
| Land Uses       | Agriculture and Food I: Ranching                |
|                 | Agriculture and Food II: Corn Belt              |
|                 | Water Economy                                   |
|                 | Fuels and Mining                                |
|                 | Forests and Timber                              |
| Manufacturing   | Manufacturing I: Steel Belt                     |
|                 | Other manufacturing and other activities        |
