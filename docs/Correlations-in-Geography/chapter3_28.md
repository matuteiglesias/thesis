**Understanding Land Uses**

Natural advantages, such as the presence of natural inputs, differ spatially, and firms may choose locations to gain access to those inputs. This section explores activities that rely heavily on natural resources or are located near the upstream end of the supply chain to save on transport costs. We identify five components characterized by spatial patterns pointing to specific natural resources.

### Agriculture and Food I: Ranching

- **Distribution**: Grazing lands of Texas' west and fertile areas for crop and fruit production in Washington state and California's Central Valley.
- **Activities**:
  - NAICS 111: Crop production
  - NAICS 112: Animal production and aquaculture
  - NAICS 311: Food manufacturing
