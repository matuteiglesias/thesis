## Abstract

In this paper, we present a technique to trace the **aggregation** of firm-level exports and imports into national aggregates.

- **Sectoral Fluctuations**: We clarify the linear relations that link sectoral fluctuations to aggregate fluctuations of an economy.
- **Aggregation of Agents**: We study the aggregation of groups of fluctuating agents within parts of the aggregate. This allows for a precise reconstruction of the aggregation of fluctuations from the micro to the macro level.

We utilize firm-level export and import data from **France Customs** over the period 1997-2013 to constrain the theoretical derivations to practical parameter regions, simplifying a generally difficult problem. Empirically constrained computational tests confirm that each analytical expression in this paper is true, either exactly or approximately.

### Key Insights

- **Postponement of the Law of Large Numbers**: Idiosyncratic variance decays more slowly than $1/N$ with the population size $N$ due to large, multiplicative micro fluctuations. This can be accounted for as a comovement among agents.
- **Concentration Effects**: This phenomenon is distinct from situations where concentration allows groups of a few large firms to drive the aggregate towards their level of volatility.
