## Key Empirical Features: Distribution of Firm Sizes and Fluctuations

Understanding the **distribution of firm sizes** and their **fluctuations** is crucial for determining the nature of the problem at hand and the path to follow for a deeper understanding. This section reviews these fundamental characteristics within the population of fluctuating French traders.

### Distribution Characteristics

- **Firm Size Distribution**: Observed through metrics such as employment levels or total sales, including domestic sales, across various regions and time periods.
- **Logarithmic Growth Rates**: Both firm sizes and their multiplicative growth rates are distributed effectively on a logarithmic scale.

This universal and robust property significantly influences the analytical steps we will undertake in this paper. The **logarithmic scale** distribution is a key feature observed across multiple populations of economic agents, guiding our understanding and approach to the problem.
